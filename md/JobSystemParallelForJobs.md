# ParallelFor jobs

When [scheduling jobs](JobSystemSchedulingJobs), there can only be one job doing one task. In a game, it is common to want to perform the same operation on a large number of objects. There is a separate job type called [IJobParallelFor](ScriptRef:Unity.Jobs.IJobParallelFor.html) to handle this. 

**Note**: A “ParallelFor” job is a collective term in Unity for any struct that implements the `IJobParallelFor` interface.

A ParallelFor job uses a [NativeArray](ScriptRef:Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.html) of data to act on as its data source. ParallelFor jobs run across multiple cores. There is one job per core, each handling a subset of the workload. `IJobParallelFor` behaves like `IJob`, but instead of a single [Execute](ScriptRef:Unity.Jobs.IJob.Execute.html) method, it invokes the `Execute` method once per item in the data source. There is an integer parameter in the `Execute` method. This index is to access and operate on a single element of the data source within the job implementation.

## An example of a ParallelFor job definition:

```
struct IncrementByDeltaTimeJob: IJobParallelFor
{
	public NativeArray<float> values;
	public float deltaTime;

	public void Execute (int index)
	{
		float temp = values[index];
		temp += deltaTime;
		values[index] = temp;
	}
}
```

## Scheduling ParallelFor jobs

When scheduling ParallelFor jobs, you must specify the length of the `NativeArray` data source that you are splitting. The Unity C# Job System cannot know which `NativeArray` you want to use as the data source if there are several in the struct. The length also tells the C# Job System how many `Execute` methods to expect.

Behind the scenes, the scheduling of ParallelFor jobs is more complicated. When scheduling ParallelFor jobs, the C# Job System divides the work into batches to distribute between cores. Each batch contains a subset of `Execute` methods. The C# Job System then schedules up to one job in Unity’s native job system per CPU core and passes that native job some batches to complete.

![A ParallelFor job dividing batches across cores](../uploads/Main/jobsystem_parallelfor_job_batches.svg)

When a native job completes its batches before others, it [steals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing) remaining batches from the other native jobs. It only steals half of a native job's remaining batches at a time, to ensure [cache locality](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12065774/why-does-cache-locality-matter-for-array-performance).

To optimize the process, you need to specify a batch count. The batch count controls how many jobs you get, and how fine-grained the redistribution of work between threads is. Having a low batch count, such as 1, gives you a more even distribution of work between threads. It does come with some overhead, so sometimes it is better to increase the batch count. Starting at 1 and increasing the batch count until there are negligible performance gains is a valid strategy. 

## An example of scheduling a ParallelFor job

**Job code**:

```
// Job adding two floating point values together
public struct MyParallelJob : IJobParallelFor
{
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeArray<float> a;
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeArray<float> b;
    public NativeArray<float> result;

    public void Execute(int i)
    {
        result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}
```

**Main thread code**:

```
NativeArray<float> a = new NativeArray<float>(2, Allocator.TempJob);

NativeArray<float> b = new NativeArray<float>(2, Allocator.TempJob);

NativeArray<float> result = new NativeArray<float>(2, Allocator.TempJob);

a[0] = 1.1;
b[0] = 2.2;
a[1] = 3.3;
b[1] = 4.4;

MyParallelJob jobData = new MyParallelJob();
jobData.a = a;  
jobData.b = b;
jobData.result = result;

// Schedule the job with one Execute per index in the results array and only 1 item per processing batch
JobHandle handle = jobData.Schedule(result.Length, 1);

// Wait for the job to complete
handle.Complete();

// Free the memory allocated by the arrays
a.Dispose();
b.Dispose();
result.Dispose();
```
