# Moving your Project to another version control system

To export your Project as a zip file that you can import into another version control system:

1. Sign into the [Unity Developer Dashboard](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/).
2. Select the Project to export.
3. In the left navigation window, click __Collaborate__, then click __Storage__.
4. In the main window, click the __START EXPORT__ button.
5. When export is complete, click the __DOWNLOAD EXPORT__  button. A zip file downloads onto your local machine.

The zip file contains all versions of all files stored in the Project’s repository, ready for import into another version control system.

**Note**: Exporting a Project does not reduce your storage usage.
