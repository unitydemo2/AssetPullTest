Structure of a Unity XCode Project
===================================


When you build a project for the iOS platform, Unity will create a folder that contains an XCode project. This project is required to compile and sign your app before deploying on devices, and it allows you to prepare and bundle your game for distribution on the App Store.

Before building the iOS project make sure that you set the __Bundle Identifier__ in __Player Settings__. You may also choose the __SDK version__ to run the game on the device or simulator.

Classes folder
--------------


This contains code that integrates the Unity Runtime and Objective-C. The contained files `main.mm` and `UnityAppController.mm/h` are the entry point of the application, and you can create your own AppDelegate, derived from UnityAppController. If you have plugins including `AppController.h` you can simply include `UnityAppController.h` instead. If you have `AppController.mm/h` in Plugins/iOS folders you can merge and rename them.

Also the `InternalProfiler.h` file defines a compiler conditional to enable the Internal Profiler. This is a folder for code that doesn't change often, and you can place your custom classes here. The changes to this folder are preserved between builds when the append mode is selected, but this function doesn't support multiple build targets and requires a fixed structure of the `Libraries` folder.

The Internal Profiler is fast and unobtrusive, and feeds basic information: 

* which subsystem is taking most of the frame time,
* .NET heap size,
* GC event count/duration.
See [built-in profiler](iphone-InternalProfiler) for further information.

Data folder
-----------


This contains the serialized game assets, and .NET assemblies (`dll` or `dat` files) as full code (or metadata if stripping is on). The `machine.config` file is the setup for various .NET services such as security, WebRequest, and more. The content of this folder is refreshed with each build, and you should not modify it.

Libraries folder
----------------


This contains the .NET assemblies translated into ARM assembler (`s` files) or `libil2cpp.a` if the project was built using IL2CPP. The `libiPhone-lib.a` file is the Unity Runtime static library, and `RegisterMonoModules.cpp` binds Unity native code with .NET. The content of this folder is refreshed with each build, and you should not modify it.

Other newly created custom folders
----------------------------------


Your custom files can be placed here.

Graphic files
-------------


Icons and splash screens (`png` files) are kept in asset catalogs found in the `Unity-iPhone` folder. These files are automatically managed by Unity. Launch Screens, their XML Interface Builders (`xib` files) and Storyboard files are stored in the project’s root folder. You can set them up in __Player Settings__. When creating custom launch images, make sure you adhere to [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/launch-screen/). 

Property List file
------------------


The `Info.plist` is managed via __Player Settings__ in Unity. This file is updated when building the player, instead of being replaced. You should not modify it unless it is really needed.

Other files
-----------


These include the XCode Project file (`xcodeproj` file), and framework links that are only shown in the __Project Navigator__.
