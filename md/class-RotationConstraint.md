# Rotation Constraints

A Rotation Constraint component rotates a GameObject to match the rotation of its source GameObjects.

### Properties

| **Property:** || **Function:** |
|:---|:---|
|__Activate__||After you rotate the constrained GameObject and its source GameObjects, click __Activate__ to save this information. __Activate__ saves the current offset from the source GameObjects in __Rotation At Rest__ and __Rotation Offset__ then checks __Is Active__ and __Lock__.|
|__Zero__||Sets the rotation of the constrained GameObject to the source GameObjects. __Zero__ resets the __Rotation At Rest__ and __Rotation Offset__ fields, then checks __Is Active__ and __Lock__.|
|__Is Active__||Toggles whether or not to evaluate the Constraint. To also apply the Constraint, make sure __Lock__ is checked.|
|__Weight__||The strength of the Constraint. A weight of 1 causes the Constraint to rotate this GameObject at the same rate as its source GameObjects. A weight of 0 removes the effect of the Constraint completely. This weight affects all source GameObjects. Each GameObject in the __Sources__ list also has a weight.|
|__Constraint Settings__||&nbsp;|
|| Lock|Toggle to let the Constraint rotate the GameObject. Uncheck this property to edit the rotation of this GameObject. You can also edit the __Rotation At Rest__ and __Rotation Offset__ properties. If __Is Active__ is checked, the Constraint updates the __Rotation At Rest__ or __Rotation Offset__ properties for you as you rotate the GameObject or its __Source__ GameObjects. When you are satisfied with your changes, check __Lock__ to let the Constraint to control this GameObject. This property has no effect in Play Mode.|
|| Rotation At Rest|The X, Y, and Z values to use when __Weight__ is 0 or when the corresponding __Freeze Rotation Axes__ is not checked. To edit these fields, uncheck __Lock__.|
|| Rotation Offset|The X, Y, and Z offset from the transform that is imposed by the Constraint. To edit these fields, uncheck __Lock__.|
|| Freeze Rotation Axes|Check X, Y, or Z to allow the Constraint to control the corresponding axes. Uncheck an axis to stop the Constraint from controlling it. This allows you to edit, animate, or script the unfrozen axis.|
|__Sources__||The list of GameObjects that constrain this GameObject. Unity evaluates source GameObjects in the order they appear in this list. This order affects how this Constraint rotates the constrained GameObject. To get the result you want, drag and drop items in this list. Each source has a weight from 0 to 1. |
